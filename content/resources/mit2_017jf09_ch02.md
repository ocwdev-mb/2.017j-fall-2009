description: Chapter from a textbook on system design for uncertainty. Topics include
  definition of a system, time-invariant systems, linear systems, the impulse response
  and convolution, causal systems, an example of finding the impulse response, complex
  numbers, the Fourier transform, the angle of a transfer function, and the Laplace
  transform.
