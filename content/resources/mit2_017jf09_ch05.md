  short term statistics, the central role of the Gaussian and Rayleigh distributions,
  frequency of upcrossings, maxima at and above a given level, 1/N''th highest maxima,
  1/N''th average value, and the 100-year wave: estimate from short-term statistics.'

Chapter from a textbook on system design for uncertainty. Topics include short term statistics, the central role of the Gaussian and Rayleigh distributions, frequency of upcrossings, maxima at and above a given level, 1/N'th highest maxima, 1/N'th average value, and the 100-year wave: estimate from short-term statistics.
