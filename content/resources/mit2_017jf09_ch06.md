description: Chapter from a textbook on system design for uncertainty. Topics include
  water waves, constitutive and governing relations, rotation and viscous effects,
  velocity potential, linear waves, deepwater waves, wave loading of stationary and
  moving bodies, limits of the linear theory, and the characteristics of real ocean
  waves.
