description: Chapter from a textbook on system design for uncertainty. Topics include
  control systems, loop shaping, the roots of stability, Nyquist criterion, design
  for nominal performance, design for robustness, robust performance, implications
  of Bode's integral, and the recipe for loopshaping.
